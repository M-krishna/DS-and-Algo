# Golang Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains Golang based examples of many popular algorithms and data structures.

# Data Structures
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data.

# Algorithms

# TODOs
- [ ] Refactor both data structures and algorithms to adapt testing.
- [ ] Add test cases for data structures and algorithms.
- [ ] Make standalone packages for individual data structure.
